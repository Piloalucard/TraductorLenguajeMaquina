how they are used.  In order to use an item in this library, UTIL.LIB must be
linked in with your executable code using one of the following commands:

         tlink object files,,,util         (TASM)
         link object files,,,util;         (MASM)
         ml source files util.lib          (MASM 6.0 and above)

Bin2Dec         (procedure)

Translate a signed 16 bit binary number into its decimal representation as
a string of ASCII characters at a specified memory location.

usage:

         Input:  ax = number to be converted
                 ds:di = location of start of output character string

         EXTRN   Bin2Dec : NEAR
         call    Bin2Dec

         Output: ds:di = location of first character after output

         All registers except ax and di are preserved

CCheck          (procedure)

Called immediately following a DOS function call which returns with the C
flag set if there was an error and the error number in ax.  If the C flag
is set, CCheck displays an appropriate error message and terminates the
program.

usage:

         ...
         int     21h      ; DOS call
         EXTRN   CCheck : NEAR
         call    CCheck

         If the DOS call showed an error, no return.  If not, returns with
all registers preserved.

DBin2Dec        (procedure)

Similar to Bin2Dec, except that a 32 bit integer in eax is translated into
a decimal character string.

usage:

         Input:  eax = number to be converted
                 ds:di = location of start of output character string

         EXTRN   DBin2Dec : NEAR
         call    DBin2Dec

         Output: ds:di = location of first character after output

         All registers except eax and di are preserved

Dec2Bin         (procedure)

Translate an ASCII character string representing a signed decimal number
into its binary equivalent, returning that value and the location of the
first character after the end of the string translated.

usage:

         Input:  ds:si = location of start of character string to
                         translate

         EXTRN   Dec2Bin : NEAR
         call    Dec2Bin 

         Output: If C Flag is clear, translation was successful and
                    ax = value
                    ds:si = location of first character after input
                 if C Flag is set, an error occurred (overflow, no number,
                    etc.) ds:si = location at which error was found.

         All registers except ax and si are preserved

Dec2DBin        (procedure)

Similar to Dec2Bin, except that a 32 bit integer is returned in eax.

                    eax = value
                    ds:si = location of first character after input
                 if C Flag is set, an error occurred (overflow, no number,
                    etc.) ds:si = location at which error was found.

         All registers except eax and si are preserved

Dec2FP      (procedure)

Translate an ASCII character string representing a signed floating
point number into its binary floating point equivalent, returning the
value on the FPU stack and the location of the first character after
the end of the string translated.

usage:

            translate
        three empty entries on FPU stack required

above.  If a lower version is in use, assumes the PSP segment is in es and
displays a warning message to that effect.

         OutPut: eax contains the (pseudo) random number

         eax, bx, edx, si, and di are destroyed

Timer           (procedure)

Returns the number of clock ticks since the last time it was called (at about
18.2 clock ticks per second). The first time it is called, it returns the
number of clock ticks since midnight.

usage:

         EXTRN   Timer : NEAR
         call    Timer

upper case letter while leaving all other characters unchanged

usage:

         ...
         mov     bx, OFFSET UpIt ;         ds must contain @data
         mov     al, byte to translate
         xlat
WCheck          (procedure)

Like CCheck, except to be called after a DOS file write operation in which
it is also to be checked that the requested number of bytes were written.
Compares ax, the actual number of bytes written, to cx, the number re-
quested, and if not equal, terminates the program with an error message.  If
the correct number of bytes was written, calls CCheck and returns to caller if
CCheck returns.

usage:

         ...
         int     21h      ; DOS Write call
         EXTRN   WCheck : NEAR
         call    WCheck

         If the DOS call showed an error or the number of bytes written was
unequal to the number requested, no return.  If no error was detected, returns
with all registers preserved.
